# Rick and Morty Challenge

Command line app that solves the Rick And Morty Challenge proposed by Chipax.

## Technicals

### About the project

To solve the challenge I used **NodeJS** to make a command line application with **JavaScript** because it is one of my favorites programming languages and I feel quite comfortable using it.

This project depends on **Axios** to make HTTPS requests to the Rick and Morty API.

Also, instead of the default Rick and Morty REST API, I chose to use the **GraphQL** API so I could get all the data that I wanted at once, and shape it right from the API server itself for further processing.
